🏙️ Event-Driven Multi-Agent Simulation for Smart Cities
This project simulates intelligent traffic control in smart cities using a modular, event-driven multi-agent framework built with JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework).
🚦 Motivation
Modern smart cities generate massive real-time data from IoT-enabled devices like:
- Traffic sensors
- GPS trackers
- Energy meters
Yet, centralized systems struggle with:
- Sudden congestion
- Emergency vehicle routing
- Adaptive decision-making
This framework addresses those limitations by combining agent-based modeling with event-driven simulation, enabling decentralized, intelligent responses.
🧠 Key Features
- JADE-based agents for traffic signals and vehicles
- Real-time state switching and lifecycle control
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Event-driven behaviors using TickerBehaviour
- Scalable container setup via Main.java
🛠️ Technologies
- Java 17
- JADE Framework
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub
